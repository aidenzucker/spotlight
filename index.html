            <p>DO some people have a special talent for serendipity? And if so, why?</p>

            <p>In 2008, an inventor named Steve Hollinger lobbed a digital camera across his studio toward a pile of pillows. “I wasn’t trying to make an invention,” he said. “I was just playing.” As his camera flew, it recorded what most of us would call a bad photo. But when Mr. Hollinger peered at that blurry image, he saw new possibilities. Soon, he was building a throwable videocamera in the shape of a baseball, equipped with gyroscopes and sensors. The Squito (as he named it) could be rolled into a crawlspace or thrown across a river — providing a record of the world from all kinds of “nonhuman” perspectives. Today, Mr. Hollinger holds six patents related to throwable cameras.</p>

            <p>A surprising number of the conveniences of modern life were invented when someone stumbled upon a discovery or capitalized on an accident: the microwave oven, safety glass, smoke detectors, artificial sweeteners, X-ray imaging. Many blockbuster drugs of the 20th century emerged because a lab worker picked up on the “wrong” information.</p>

            <p>While researching breakthroughs like these, I began to wonder whether we can train ourselves to become more serendipitous. How do we cultivate the art of finding what we’re not seeking?</p>

            <p>For decades, a University of Missouri information scientist named Sanda Erdelez has been asking that question. Growing up in Croatia, she developed a passion for losing herself in piles of books and yellowed manuscripts, hoping to be surprised. Dr. Erdelez told me that Croatian has no word to capture the thrill of the unexpected discovery, so she was delighted when — after moving to the United States on a Fulbright scholarship in the 1980s — she learned the English word “serendipity.”</p>

            <p>Today we think of serendipity as something like dumb luck. But its original meaning was very different.</p>

            <p>In 1754, a belle-lettrist named Horace Walpole retreated to a desk in his gaudy castle in Twickenham, in southwest London, and penned a letter. Walpole had been entranced by a Persian fairy tale about three princes from the Isle of Serendip who possess superpowers of observation. In his letter, Walpole suggested that this old tale contained a crucial idea about human genius: “As their highnesses travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accident and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of.” And he proposed a new word — “serendipity” — to describe this princely talent for detective work. At its birth, serendipity meant a skill rather than a random stroke of good fortune.</p>

            <p>Dr. Erdelez agrees with that definition. She sees serendipity as something people do. In the mid-1990s, she began a study of about 100 people to find out how they created their own serendipity, or failed to do so.</p>

            <p>Her qualitative data — from surveys and interviews — showed that the subjects fell into three distinct groups. Some she called “non-encounterers”; they saw through a tight focus, a kind of chink hole, and they tended to stick to their to-do lists when searching for information rather than wandering off into the margins. Other people were “occasional encounterers,” who stumbled into moments of serendipity now and then. Most interesting were the “super-encounterers,” who reported that happy surprises popped up wherever they looked. The super-encounterers loved to spend an afternoon hunting through, say, a Victorian journal on cattle breeding, in part, because they counted on finding treasures in the oddest places. In fact, they were so addicted to prospecting that they would find information for friends and colleagues.</p>

            <p>You become a super-encounterer, according to Dr. Erdelez, in part because you believe that you are one — it helps to assume that you possess special powers of perception, like an invisible set of antennas, that will lead you to clues.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, I was having a drink in Cambridge, Mass., with a friend, a talented journalist who was piecing together a portrait of a secretive Wall Street wizard. “But I haven’t found the real story yet; I’m still gathering string,” my friend told me, invoking an old newsroom term to describe the first stage of reporting, when you’re looking for something that you can’t yet name. Later that night, as I walked home from the bar, I realized “gathering string” is just another way of talking about super-encountering. After all, “string” is the stuff that accumulates in a journalist’s pocket. It’s the note you jot down in your car after the interview, the knickknack you notice on someone’s shelf, or the anomaly that jumps out at you in Appendix B of an otherwise boring research study.</p>

            <p>As I navigated the brick sidewalk, passing under the pinkish glow of a streetlight, I thought about how string was probably hiding all around me. A major story might lurk behind the Harvard zoology museum ahead or in the plane soaring above. String is everywhere for the taking, if you have the talent to take it.</p>

            <p>In the 1960s, Gay Talese, then a young reporter, declared that “New York is a city of things unnoticed” and delegated himself to be the one who noticed. Thus, he transformed the Isle of Manhattan into the Isle of Serendip: He traced the perambulations of feral cats, cataloged shoeshine purveyors, tracked down statistics related to the bathrooms at Yankee Stadium and discovered a colony of ants at the top of the Empire State Building. He published his findings in a little book titled “New York: A Serendipiter’s Journey.”</p>

            <p>The term “serendipiter” breathed new life into Walpole’s word, turning serendipity into a protagonist and a practitioner. After all, those ants at the top of the Empire State Building didn’t find themselves; Mr. Talese had to notice them, which was no easy matter. Similarly, Dr. Erdelez came up with the term super-encounterer to give us a way to talk about the people rather than just the discoveries. Without such words, we tend to become dazzled by the happy accident itself, to think of it as something that exists independent of an observer.</p>

            <p>We can slip into a twisted logic in which we half-believe the penicillin picked Alexander Fleming to be its emissary, or that the moons of Jupiter wanted to be seen by Galileo. But discoveries are products of the human mind.</p>

            <p>As people dredge the unknown, they are engaging in a highly creative act. What an inventor “finds” is always an expression of him- or herself. Martin Chalfie, who won a Nobel Prize for his work connected with green fluorescent protein — the stuff that makes jellyfish glow green — told me that he and several other Nobel Prize winners benefited from a chain of accidents and chance encounters on the way to their revelations. Some scientists even embrace a kind of “free jazz” method, he said, improvising as they go along: “I’ve heard of people getting good results after accidentally dropping their experimental preparations on the floor, picking them up, and working on them nonetheless,” he added.</p>

            <p>So how many big ideas emerge from spills, crashes, failed experiments and blind stabs? One survey of patent holders (the PatVal study of European inventors, published in 2005) found that an incredible 50 percent of patents resulted from what could be described as a serendipitous process. Thousands of survey respondents reported that their idea evolved when they were working on an unrelated project — and often when they weren’t even trying to invent anything. This is why we need to know far more about the habits that transform a mistake into a breakthrough.</p>

            <p>IN the late 1980s, Dr. John Eng, an endocrinologist, became curious about certain animal poisons that damaged the pancreas, so he ordered lizard venom through the mail and began to play around with it. As a result of this curious exercise, he discovered a new compound in the saliva of a Gila monster, and that in turn led to a treatment for diabetes. One of Dr. Eng’s associates (quoted in a 2005 newspaper article) remarked that he was capable of seeing “patterns that others don’t see.”</p>

            <p>Is this pattern-finding ability similar to the artistic skill of a painter like Georgia O’Keeffe? Is it related to the string-gathering prowess of Gay Talese? We still know so little about creative observation that it’s impossible to answer such questions.</p>

            <p>That’s why we need to develop a new, interdisciplinary field — call it serendipity studies — that can help us create a taxonomy of discoveries in the chemistry lab, the newsroom, the forest, the classroom, the particle accelerator and the hospital. By observing and documenting the many different “species” of super-encounterers, we might begin to understand their minds.</p>

            <p>A number of pioneering scholars have already begun this work, but they seem to be doing so in their own silos and without much cross-talk. In a 2005 paper (“Serendipitous Insights Involving Nonhuman Primates”), two experts from the Washington National Primate Research Center in Seattle cataloged the chance encounters that yielded new insights from creatures like the pigtail macaque. Meanwhile, the authors of a paper titled “On the Exploitation of Serendipity in Drug Discovery” puzzled over the reasons the 1950s and ’60s saw a bonanza of breakthroughs in psychiatric medication, and why that run of serendipity ended. And in yet another field of study, a few information scientists are trying to understand the effects of being bombarded on social media sites with countless tantalizing pieces of “string.”</p>

            <p>What could these researchers discover if they came together for one big conversation?</p>

            <p>Of course, even if we do organize the study of serendipity, it will always be a whimsical undertaking, given that the phenomenon is difficult to define, amazingly variable and hard to capture in data. The clues will no doubt emerge where we least expect them, perhaps in the fungi clinging to the walls of parking garages or the mating habits of bird-watchers. The journey will be maddening, but the potential insights could be profound: One day we might be able to stumble upon new and better ways of getting lost.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Looking back at all the tools and techniques that I've developed over the years as a writer, it occurs to me that most of them are, in one way or another, grappling with two critical mental forces: the power (and weakness) of human memory, and the sometimes overwhelming drive to procrastinate.</p>

            <p>Let's start with memory, and put off procrastination for the time being. (Appropriate, right?) There are a number of ways that your memory can get in the way of a good writing session when you're in the middle of a project, mostly because you've remembered too much. But when you're just starting out on a project, when you're in that early stage where you're still trying to figure out what you want to write in the first place—at this stage, it's the frailty of memory that causes problems. This is because most good ideas (whether they're ideas for narrative structure, a particular twist in the argument, or a broader topic) come into our minds as hunches: small fragments of a larger idea, hints and intimations. Many of these ideas sit around for months or years before they coalesce into something useful, often by colliding with another hunch. (I wrote a chapter about this phenomenon in my last book, Where Good Ideas Come From.)</p>

            <p>The problem with hunches is that it's incredibly easy to forget them, precisely because they're not fully-baked ideas. You're reading an article, and a little spark of an idea pops into your head, but by the time you've finished the article, you're checking your email, or responding to some urgent request from your colleague, and the next thing you know, you've forgotten the hunch for good. And even the ones that you do manage to retain often don't turn out to be useful to you for months or years, which gives you countless opportunities to lose track of them.</p>

            <p>This is why for the past eight years or so I've been maintaining a single document where I keep all my hunches: ideas for articles, speeches, software features, startups, ways of framing a chapter I know I'm going to write, even whole books. I now keep it as a Google document so I can update it from wherever I happen to be. There's no organizing principle to it, no taxonomy--just a chronological list of semi-random ideas that I've managed to capture before I forgot them. I call it the spark file.</p>

            <p>Now, the spark file itself is not all that unusual: that's why Moleskins or Evernote are so useful to so many people. But the key habit that I've tried to cultivate is this: every three or four months, I go back and re-read the entire spark file. And it's not an inconsequential document: it's almost fifty pages of hunches at this point, the length of several book chapters. But what happens when I re-read the document that I end up seeing new connections that hadn't occurred to me the first (or fifth) time around: the idea I had in 2008 that made almost no sense in 2008, but that turns out to be incredibly useful in 2012, because something has changed in the external world, or because some other idea has supplied the missing piece that turns the hunch into something actionable. Sure, I end up reading over many hunches that never went anywhere, but there are almost always little sparks that I'd forgotten that suddenly seem more promising. And it's always encouraging to see the hunches that turned into fully-realized projects or even entire books.</p>

            <p>As an exercise, I just went back and grabbed a random sample of seven entries in my spark file from, all of them written about six years ago. They were, in reverse chronological order:</p>

            <p>• a somewhat cryptic op-ed idea about eliminating airplane luggage altogether, a hunch that seems to have been a dead end for me;
            <br><br>
            • an idea for a public panel discussion with a friend that I never actually put together, but which would still be a great event, and hopefully one day I'll figure out a way to make it work;
            <br><br>
            • my first stab at the title of what would become, four years later, Where Good Ideas Come From (my initial version was a question: Where Do Good Ideas Come From?);
            <br><br>
            • a little theory about the varying emotional effects of good and bad news on entrepreneurs, which I have talked about in meetings a hundred times, but not yet written about;
            <br><br>
            • a paragraph-long sketch for a book about Darwin, still unwritten, though some elements of this hunch made it into Good Ideas;
            <br><br>
            • and, finally, a note about a quotation-management tool that would, five years later, turn into the Findings.com service that I helped create.</p>

            <p>I'd say that's a representative sample of the spark file: a few hits, a few misses, and a few yet-to-be-determined. But this kind of inventory doesn't quite convey the most interesting part of the experience, which is the feeling of reading through your own words describing new ideas as they are occurring to you for the first time. In a funny way, it feels a bit like you are brainstorming with past versions of yourself. You see your past self groping for an idea that now seems completely obvious five years later. Or, even better, you're reminded of an idea that seems suddenly relevant to a new project you've just started
thinking about.</p>

            <p>Needless to say, maintaining and re-reading a spark file is useful for more than just writers, but I think it's a habit that is particularly suited to the special challenges of writing. I often find myself writing out full sentences of an argument or description, instead of just jotting down shorthand summaries, even though I don't yet know where the sentences are ultimately going to appear. The key is to capture as many hunches as possible, and to spend as little time as possible organizing or filtering or prioritizing them. (Keeping a single, chronological file is central to the process, because it forces you to scroll through the whole list each time you want to add something new.) Just get it all down as it comes to you, and make regular visits back to re-acquaint yourself with all your past explorations. You'll be shocked how many useful hunches you've forgotten.</p>

            <h2>On building IBM’s new design studio</h2>
            <h4>Adam Cutler</h4>

          </div>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>I’m about to start my second year as design studio director of IBM Design. Looking back, I’m reminded of how much my team has learned and delivered. Yet for all of our planning and strategizing for the opening of IBM’s new studio in November 2013, nothing prepared us for the effects of what happens when adding more than 100 designers—all new hires—simultaneously.</p>

            <p>The experience has convinced me that guided serendipity is the way forward for our studios.</p>

            <h3>Me and my role</h3>
            <p>IBM Design was formed in 2012 to help our company impact humanity in ways that matter and endure. We do this by partnering with disciplines across the business—project management, engineering, marketing and sales—to make the user the center of our products. Aligning everyone with the user, we apply IBM Design best practices, ideas and skills in an environment that cultivates creativity, curiosity and empathy.</p>

            <p>I was brought on as a design studio director to bring this to life at the level of practice. No matter how I slice it, it’s a sizable and juicy design problem to solve.</p>

            <h3>Initial conditions</h3>
            <p>Something I learned quickly is that our best guesses only served as the jumping off point for how we thought the IBM Design studio could, should or would work. As I grasped this, I started thinking about how to harness these initial conditions as raw potential instead of treating them as something to dominate.</p>

            <p>This led me to believe that mastery isn’t so much an attainable end result as it is a quest; it’s the application of ongoing curiosity to continuously expand and improve our skills. Iteration and refinement is how we’ll succeed, not just ambition and expertise. If we are to provide an environment in which our designers create their best work, we must respond, flex and adapt the environment to the endless variety of design problems we encounter.</p>

            <p>We originally designed our studio space around the concept of semi-autonomous design teams working in close proximity in order to cross-pollinate across products and portfolios. Each design team has a pod of adjustable desks, three to four moveable white boards and a 60-inch monitor to project their work. This was my set of initial conditions.</p>

            <p>The day after we opened the studio to the world, I told each pod of designers that I expected them to make their space their own—to arrange it in any manner that would help them do their best work. As a result, no two pods are the same. They’re constantly shifting in ways that I could never have planned.</p>

            <p>Now, I optimize for possibilities rather than outcomes at IBM Design. I give each pod the basics, and they show each other what can be done—and they show me ways to take their ideas and scale them globally.</p>

            <h3>Guided serendipity</h3>
            <dt>serendipity |ser-әn-dip-itē|</dt>
            <em>noun</em>
            <dd>the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way</dd><br>

            <p>As our design teams flow through their tasks, so do their spaces. The recursive effect through the studio helps spread ideas that, in turn, influence the quality of everyone’s work.</p>

            <p>I just returned from a field trip to Steelcase world headquarters, where I was lucky enough to speak with some of their most talented and visionary designers and get their point of view on workspace design. Our discussions spurred many ideas for the studio of 2015, but none so compelling as the concept of a “Serendipity Engine.”</p>

            <p>Generating the much-sought-after state of flow so many designers crave is more than providing conditions like open space and quiet areas with mobile furniture. Rather, true serendipity is found in the circulatory flow of a space. To design with the intent of providing “a-ha” moments for all is a much different way of looking at things.</p>

            <p>By designing the circulatory flow of our studio, the hope is to create a self-sustaining culture of curiosity and collaboration that feeds itself by mobilizing thoughts, ideas and possibilities. If our circulation is open and free, it provides every designer more and better opportunities to take quick, exploratory laps around a problem to arrive at the best solutions for our users.</p>

            <h3>Challenges and problems to solve</h3>
            <p>Inculcating a design culture is not an overnight process. I was reminded of this during my Steelcase visit, as I furiously scribbled “behavior/time=culture.” When considering goals for the studio of 2015, my focus is reducing and removing drag from collaboration, whether in a physical or virtual studio. Since the majority of IBM designers are not located in a studio environment, my next real challenge is to foster guided serendipity and flow beyond a four-walled structure. What we need now is a virtual studio model, wherein all IBM designers are not just linked together, but enabled to do their best work, regardless of how and where they sit.</p>

            <p>One idea we’ve been experimenting with is ad hoc avatars. One of our designers is working remotely for the next three months. Neither she nor her team want to be disconnected, so they bought an IV pole from a seller on eBay and rigged a support clamp for an iPad. Now they connect with her over FaceTime and “seat” her at her desk or raise the pole and wheel “her” around the space. Now, if we can hack a Roomba so she can control her own movements, I think we might be onto something.</p>

            <p>If we’re successful with this blending of virtual and physical workspaces, we’ll be able to design against values, instead of trends, at a global scale. The result? Products and experiences that are idea-driven and executed with the amazing technological capabilities that IBM has been known for over the years.</p>

            <p>If you’re a busy professional like me, chances are your calendar looks a lot like a Tetris board. Every minute of every day is accounted for. Some hyper-organization is necessary, of course. How else would business get done? But on a recent trip to Chicago, my colleague Aaron Ferber reminded me of the importance of leaving room in one’s personal and work life for serendipity. He shared the following story with the IDEO Chicago studio. It resonated with his fellow designers and me and I thought my LinkedIn readers would enjoy it, too. Here’s what Aaron had to say:</p>

            <p>“I’m the vacation planner in my family. My organizational approach is simple: plan every day, but not a single minute. I do enough research so we go to interesting places, but not so much that there’s no time left for the unexpected, because those chance moments are sometimes the most delightful and memorable.</p>

            <p>I came across a term a few years ago that perfectly encapsulates my approach to vacation planning: ‘engineered serendipity.’ The notion that you could intentionally design your life to encounter surprises struck a chord with me and reminded me of a trip my wife and I once took to Honduras.</p>

            <p>We’d just finished a short stint volunteering at an orphanage and were back in the city of La Ceiba, about to catch our flight home. Before leaving, however, we wanted to buy a hammock as a souvenir. We’d seen lots of beautiful, handmade hammocks for sale by local craftsman during our stay, but our last day in Honduras happened to be a holiday, and all the street vendors were closed. The only place that was open was the mall. The stores there had a few hammocks, but they were mass manufactured, not made by hand, and were much more expensive. Disappointed and running out of time, we gave up and hopped into a cab.</p>

            <p>On a whim, I mentioned to the driver that we were looking for a hammock, did he know where we could get one? He paused, thought for a bit, then slowly nodded his head. ‘Si,’ he said, and threw the car in drive without further explanation.</p>

            <p>After some time, we pulled up in front of a large, cinder block building on the outskirts of town. It didn’t have many windows, just a single door on the side. The driver slammed the car in park and hopped out without saying a word. My wife and I sat in the back and exchanged worried glances. As our driver walked up to a group of uniformed guys standing outside the building, it dawned on us: the men were police officers and the building was a jail.</p>

            <p>After a few very long minutes, the driver returned. He told us they had a hammock for sale. My wife and I looked warily at each other. Was this a scam? Were we going to be shaken down for a bribe? Or should we trust him? Desperate, and more than a bit curious, we got out of the cab.</p>

            <p>An officer told us to empty our pockets before entering the building. Handing over our bags and wallets (!), we stepped into the jail, which was basically one giant room surrounded by bars. Dozens of guys were milling around, working out, and playing cards. Spotting visitors, they turned and stared.</p>

            <p>The officer yelled at one of the inmates. The prisoner grabbed something, hopped off his bunk, and walked over to us…hammock in hand.</p>

            <p>We stood, mouths open, as he showed off his masterpiece. Every bit the salesman, he talked about the quality of the construction, the colorful patterns, and the tassels that ran along each side. The hammock was beautiful, exactly what we wanted. His asking price was higher than we wanted, ‘But’ I said, trying to justify the purchase to my wife, ‘this hammock comes with a story!’ After some haggling, we agreed on a price. The prisoner carefully folded the hammock until it was small enough to fit through the bars. We passed a stack of cash back through the bars and thanked him.</p>

            <p>Stunned, delighted, and inspired—with a beautiful, new hammock to boot!—we climbed back into the cab and sped to the airport.</p>

            <p>So my question to you is this: How might you engineer some serendipity into your next vacation or into your day today? This could be a simple as taking a new route on your commute to work or asking someone on the street for directions instead of relying on Google Maps.</p>

            <p>Who knows, you could find nothing. But maybe, just maybe, you’ll find a hammock.</p>

            <p>What happened the last time you opened yourself up to serendipity?</p>

            <p>The history of science is full of happy accidents — most folks have heard that penicillin was discovered in 1928, when a few mold spores landed on some neglected petri dishes in a London lab. But sometimes serendipity's role is a bit less ... mainstream.</p>

            <p>Hennig Brand was a German alchemist in the 1660s. I'm not saying he was a gold digger — but he did marry first one rich lady, and then, after her death, a second rich lady. And he used their money to literally try to make gold.</p>

            <p>Back then, a lot of people thought you could change worthless materials into precious metals. And Brand was convinced he could distill gold from a golden substance that he encountered every day: human urine.</p>

            <p>He used his wife's money to build a basement laboratory and employed his stepson as a lab assistant. Then, he started collecting.</p>

            <p>Accounts from the time don't go into detail about where Brand got his raw material, or what his basement smelled like, or what the stepson thought of his new dad. But they do suggest that Brand stockpiled something like 1,500 gallons of urine. Then he set to work. One of the surviving accounts of the process begins:</p>

            <blockquote>Take a good large Quantity of New-made Urine of Beer-drinkers and evaporate it gently to the consistency of honey.</blockquote>

            <p>I'll spare you the rest — it involved lots of boiling and cooking and waiting.</p>

            <p>In the end, Brand's persistence paid off. He didn't make gold, but he did end up with a white, waxy substance that glowed in the dark. He had stumbled upon the element phosphorus. The name, appropriately, starts with "p."</p>

            <p>Phosphorus, it turns out, is an incredibly powerful element. It has been used in deadly explosives and in the synthetic fertilizers that help feed the world.</p>

            <p>Throughout history, curious minds have turned mistakes, coincidences and surprises like the discovery of phosphorus into important scientific insights.</p>

            <p>Now NPR's science blog Skunk Bear is looking for modern examples — we'd like you to send us your stories of happy accidents in the lab and in the field that led to interesting discoveries. Or maybe such stories from your friends or professors or students or colleagues — or just modern cases of scientific luck you've heard about.</p>

            <p>Our favorite stories will be honored in an awards show later this month, and one twice-lucky scientist will receive a trophy from Skunk Bear — The Golden Mole Award For Accidental Brilliance.</p>

            <h2>or: Getting Lucky is Hard Work</h2>

            <h6><a href="https://medium.com/the-philosopher-s-guide-to-startups/designing-for-serendipity-7ef0cf601214#.6fp9d0hu9">via The Philosopher’s Guide to Startups</a>

          <div class="modal-body">

            <p>Have you ever noticed that some people are consistently luckier than others? They run into just the right people at just the right time, people help them out, and they get free things more often than they should. As a result, these kinds of people end up being much more successful in life. So what’s the deal?</p>

            <p>I recently had a conversation with a friend who brought up the idea of <i>“designed serendipity.”</i> He says that even though serendipity is when good things happen by chance, if you work hard enough you can almost guarantee that they will happen.</p>

            <blockquote>This seems impossible. If luck and serendipity are inherently random, how can you guarantee that they will happen?</blockquote>

            <p>Consider the case of lottery tickets. Sure, the chance of winning a lottery may be one in a million, but if you buy one million lottery tickets, then you can almost guarantee that you will win. (I don’t actually encourage this strategy — for various other practical reasons.)</p>

            <p>The general idea is: if you put yourself in many situations where you can get lucky, the equivalent of buying a bunch of lottery tickets, you’ll probably get lucky.</p>

            <p>(And, as my friend Mathias Vestergaard notes, “If you consistently avoid being in situations where you can get lucky then you will certainly never be.”)</p>

            <p>How this actually translates into behavior will depend on the context. I’m going to talk a little bit about serendipity in startups and business, since it’s the area I’ve been thinking most about recently.</p>

            <p>Over the summer my company (One Month) participated in Y Combinator, a startup accelerator program. The stated goal there was to grow at least 10 to 20 percent (either users or revenue) every week for three months.</p>

            <p>This is really easy at first — because you have such small numbers to begin with. When you only have 100 users, it’s not hard to get another 20. You do a quick Facebook post asking all your friends to join. Congratulations, you grew 20 percent this week.</p>

            <p>So the first few weeks are easy because there’s so much low-hanging fruit –optimize your landing page a little, start a blog, send out a newsletter email, and you’re good to go.</p>

            <p>But each week it gets harder. Not only are you setting a higher bar for yourself each week, but you’re also exhausting most of your opportunities.</p>

            <p>That’s where serendipity comes in.</p>

            <blockquote>In order to be successful, you have to learn how to create your own luck.</blockquote>

            <p>At One Month, we managed to hit our growth goals week after week, but just barely.</p>

            <p>In July, it happened because a friend wrote a blog post on the LinkedIn Influencer Network about why everyone should learn how to code, and he gave a nice shoutout to One Month Rails. 80,000 people read that post, and it single-handedly got us over 250 signups.</p>

            <p>Then in August we got featured in TechCrunch and got a whopping 1200 signups in 5 days.</p>

            <p>It’s easy to look back and take for granted the fact that we got lucky. To forget all the incredibly hard work and sleepless nights that got us there. The thing is that we almost didn’t make it.</p>

            <p>I never asked my friend to write that LinkedIn post — but I did send him an email asking for introductions to people at TechCrunch, Mashable, or Wired that could write about us. In fact, I almost didn’t want him to write his post because I wanted to get an exclusive feature on a bigger site. Thankfully he did it anyway — and so we randomly woke up one morning and had more signups by 8am than we had the entire week before.</p>

            <p>We’ve been conditioned to think that successful startups grow with a beautiful, curvy, hockey-stick shaped curve:</p>

            <img srs="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WtmbluqX3wKeb-CKxGSKWQ.png">

            <p>But that’s not how it works. Growth is ugly, hard work, and it comes in spurts, with blissful highs and painful lows.</p>

            <img srs="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jMiWS7oqvATGLoRJLpjhjw.png">

            <p>So how can you make success as likely as possible?</p>

            <blockquote>I think of it as setting thousands of little serendipity bombs.</blockquote>

            <p>Serendipity bombs are little packets of potential opportunity that you create by writing an email to a friend, by going to a conference, by calling up your most active user, by experimenting with a new feature, or in any number of different way.</p>

            <p>And they’re shitty bombs because most of them fizzle before they ever have the opportunity to go off. Still, if you set enough of them, the odds slowly start to sway in your favor.</p>

            <p>I suspect that the same is true for individuals, and creativity as well (though that’s a topic I don’t know enough about). What kind of behaviors can you do that will make it more likely that you’ll get lucky?</p>

            <p>Here are a few that I do, and I invite you to suggest others:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><em>Be open to meeting new people, especially other people who consistently get “lucky.”</em> This is especially true if they don’t seem helpful to you or what you’re doing right at that moment. Luck is almost never obvious. Be nice to people. Don’t work alone at your office all day long. Spend some time each day sitting in a coffee shop. Talk to five new people a day. If you’re shy, start by just waving.</li>

                <li><em>Follow up with people when you do meet them, and explore potential opportunity further than most people would.</em> Make sure to leave every conversation with something to follow up about. Then get their email and follow up within 24 hours. Hang out with people you normally wouldn’t hang out with. Try a new group activity at least once a month (like improv comedy, creative writing, rock climbing, or dance lessons). Put yourself out there emotionally. Do good things for other people. And don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.</li>

                <li><em>Don’t be too focused on one thing or one approach.</em> Let yourself get creative. Allocate at least some time for different approaches to things you’re currently doing. After Steve Jobs dropped out of college, he sat in on a calligraphy class that he had always wanted to take but never had a good excuse to. Jobs later said, “If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.” I fucking love that.</li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>Try to design serendipity into your life and then don’t get angry when people see it as luck and ignore all the hard work you’ve put into it.</blockquote>

            <p>I’d love to hear other serendipity-designing techniques and stories of serendipity you have.</p>

            Cats, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/07/the-big-new-yorker-book-of-dogs/">not unlike dogs</a>, seem to have claimed the role of literary muses, from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/02/the-cats-of-copenhagen-james-joyce/">Joyce&#8217;s children&#8217;s books</a> to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/03/14/best-cat-stories-1953-t-s-eliot/">T. S. Eliot&#8217;s poetry</a> to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/18/hemingway-shoots-his-cat/">Hemingway&#8217;s heart</a>, by way of various other <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/02/21/cat-haters-handbook-tomi-ungerer-william-cole/">bookish cameos</a>. In 1961, 29-year-old <strong>Gay Talese</strong> penned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Serendipiters-Gay-Talese/dp/B0007DN6R4/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>New York: A Serendipiter&#8217;s Journey</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-york-a-serendipiters-journey/oclc/477242&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; an obscure out-of-print gem, in which the beloved icon of literary journalism paints an immersive, vibrant portrait of Gotham&#8217;s secret life, from its 8,485 telephone operators to its 5,000 prostitutes to its one chauffeur who has a chauffeur, and the entire bubbling cauldron of humanity in between.</p>
            <p>Among the singular subcultures Talese explores is the city&#8217;s feline fraternity:</p>
            <blockquote><p>When street traffic dwindles and most people are sleeping, some New York neighborhoods begin to crawl with cats. They move quickly through the shadows of building; night watchmen, policemen, garbage collectors and other nocturnal wanderers see them &#8212; but never for very long. A majority of them hang around the fish markets, in Greenwich Village and in the East and West Side neighborhoods where garbage can abound. No part of the city is without its strays, however, and all-night garage attendants in such busy neighborhood as Fifty-fourth Street have counted as many as twenty of then around the Ziegfeld Theatre early in the morning. Troops of cats patrol the waterfront piers at night searching for rats. Subway trackwalkers have discovered cats living in the darkness. They seem never to get hit by trains, though some are occasionally liquidated by the third Rail. About twenty-five cats live 75 feet below the west end of Grand Central Terminal, are fed by the underground workers, and never wander up into the daylight.</p>
            <p>The roving, independent, self-laundering cats of the streets live a life strangely different from New York&#8217;s kept, apartment-house cats.</p>
            <p>[…]</p>
            <p>Social climbing among the stray cats of Gotham is not common. They rarely acquire a better mailing address out of choice. They usually die within the blocks of their birth, although one flea-bitten specimen picked up by the ASPCA was adopted by a wealthy woman; it now lives in a luxurious East Side apartment and spends the summer at the lady&#8217;s estate on Long Island.</p></blockquote>

            <p>Talese goes on to illuminate the hierarchy of the feline social order:</p>
            <blockquote><p>In every New York neighborhood the strays are dominated by a &#8216;boss&#8217; &#8212; the largest, strongest tomcat. But, except for the boss, there is not much organization in the street&#8217;s cat society. Within the society, however, there are three &#8216;types&#8217; of cats &#8212; wild cats, Bohemians, and part-time grocery store (or restaurant) cats.</p>
            <p>The wild cats rely on an occasional loose garbage lid or on rats for food, wand will have little or nothing to do with people &#8212; even those who would feed them. These most unkept of strays have a recognizable haunted look, a wide-eyed, wild expression, and they usually are found around the waterfront.</p>
            <p>The Bohemian, however, is more tractable. It does not run from people. Often, it is fed in the streets daily by sensitive cat-lovers (mostly women) who call the strays &#8216;little people,&#8217; &#8216;angels,&#8217; or &#8216;darlings,&#8217; and are indignant when the objects of their charity are referred to as &#8216;alley cats.&#8217; So punctual are most Bohemians at feeding time that one cat-lover has advanced the theory that cats can tell time. He cited a gray tabby that appears five days a week, precisely at 5:30 P.M., in an office building at Broadway and Seventeenth Street, where the elevator men feed it. But the cat never shows up on Saturday or Sundays; it seems to know people don&#8217;t work on those days.</p>
            <p>The part-time grocery store (or restaurant) cat, often a reformed Bohemian, eats well and keeps rodents away, but it usually uses the store as a hotel and prefers to spend the nights prowling in the streets. Despite its liberal working schedule, it still assumes most of the privileges of a related breed &#8212; the full-time, or wholly nonstray, grocery store at &#8212; including the right to sleep in the window. A reformed Bohemian at a Bleecker Street delicatessen hides behind the door and chases away all other Bohemians looking for hangouts.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Having just finished an advance copy of the inimitable <a href="http://wendymacnaughton.com" target="_blank">Wendy MacNaughton&#8217;</a>s forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Cat-Story-Desperation-Technology/dp/1608199770/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><em>Lost Cat: A True Story of Love, Desperation, and GPS Technology</em></a> &#8212; a heartbreaking, heartwarming, hopelessly hilarious treasure of a tale, penned by writer extraordinaire <a href="http://www.carolinepaul.com/" target="_blank">Caroline Paul</a> and tenderly illustrated by Wendy herself &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t resist asking Wendy, a <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/11/30/susan-sontag-on-art/">frequent</a> <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/03/susan-sontag-on-love/">collaborator</a>, to illustrate Talese&#8217;s feline archetypes. She kindly and brilliantly obliged:</p>

            <p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/04/09/lost-cat-wendy-macnaughton-caroline-paul/">Lost Cat is here!</a></em></p>
            <p>But, of course, this being Talese, we soon realize cats are but a vehicle for driving home a larger point about New York changing landscape and the era&#8217;s tectonic cultural shifts:</p>
            <blockquote><p>The number of full-time cats, incidentally, has diminished greatly since the decline of the small food store and the rise of supermarkets in New York, With better rat-proofing methods, improved packaging of foods and more sanitary conditions, such chain stores as the A&#038;P rarely keep a cat full-time.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Wedged between E. B. White&#8217;s indispensable 1949 classic <a href="http://literaryjukebox.brainpickings.org/post/46068858669"><em>Here Is New York</em></a> and Jan Morris&#8217;s 1987 literary travelogue <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/17/manhattan-45/"><em>Manhattan 45</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-York-Serendipiters-Gay-Talese/dp/B0007DN6R4/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>New York: A Serendipiter&#8217;s Journey</em></strong></a> is exquisite in its entirety. Its title, aptly so, is an allusion to the fairy tale <em>The Three Princes of Serendip</em>, who in their travels were constantly finding splendid and interesting things they didn&#8217;t expect or seek.</p>
